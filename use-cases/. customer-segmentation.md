# Use Case: Customer Segmentation

**Objective:** Segment customers based on their purchase frequency.

**Steps:**
1. Calculate the total number of purchases for each customer.
2. Categorize customers into segments based on the number of purchases.

## Example Query
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    COUNT(order_id) AS total_purchases,
    CASE
        WHEN COUNT(order_id) > 10 THEN 'High Value'
        WHEN COUNT(order_id) BETWEEN 5 AND 10 THEN 'Medium Value'
        ELSE 'Low Value'
    END AS customer_segment
FROM 
    orders
GROUP BY 
    customer_id;
